## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design with media queries
- Linear gradients, transitions, and subtle shadows for a modern UI

### What I Learned

During this project, I improved my understanding of:
- Using semantic HTML for better structure and accessibility.
- Applying CSS Grid with repeat(auto-fit, minmax()) for flexible layouts.
- Enhancing typography using gradient text with background-clip: text.
- Creating subtle hover animations using transform, box-shadow, and transition.
- Making images responsive using object-fit, border-radius, and shadow adjustments.

### Continued development

I plan to: 

- Refine image responsiveness for high-resolution displays.
- Explore container queries for more adaptive layouts.
- Add light and dark mode support using CSS custom properties.
- Continue experimenting with smooth hover transitions and micro-interactions.

### Useful resources
