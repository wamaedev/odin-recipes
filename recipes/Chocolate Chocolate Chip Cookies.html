        <h3>Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies Ingredients</h3>
        <p>These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade chocolate chocolate chip cookie recipe: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sugar: The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar. </li>
          <li>Butter: Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
          <li>Eggs: Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together. </li>
          <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies. </li>
          <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure. </li>
          <li>Cocoa powder: They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!</li>
          <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
          <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty.</li>
          <li>Chocolate chips: You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.</li>
        </ul>
