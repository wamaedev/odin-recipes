        <p>How to Make Lemon Blueberry Pound Cake</p>
        <p>Making Lemon Blueberry Pound Cake much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Step 1:</b>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan.</li>
          <li><b>Step 2:</b>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light in color and fluffy, about 5 to 7 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in lemon extract.</li>
          <li><b>Step 3:</b>Combine flour, baking powder, and lemon zest; gradually stir into cake batter alternating with milk. I like to use a spatula and stir by hand, mixing just until blended so the batter is not over mixed, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl often. Gently fold in blueberries; spoon batter into the prepared pan.</li>
          <li><b>Step 4:</b>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes. Let cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
