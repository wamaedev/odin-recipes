  <h3>How to Make Chocolate Cupcakes</h3>
  <p>Making homemade chocolate cupcakes is so much easier than you would expect. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect from this simple recipe:</p>
  <p>Sift the dry ingredients (except the sugar) together. Cream the butter and sugar together. Then add the eggs and vanilla. Alternate adding the dry ingredients and milk; mix until just combined. Spoon batter into prepared cupcake cups — only fill the cups ½ of the way full so they don't overflow in the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Frost as desired.</p>
