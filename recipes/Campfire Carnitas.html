  <p>How to Make Campfire Carnitas</p>
  <p>Making Campfire Carnitas much easier than it looks. You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Step 1:</b>Cut pork into 2-inch pieces. Stack 2 (7x10x3-inch) disposable foil baking pans and transfer in the pork. Season with salt, pepper, and oregano, and toss with your hands until everything is evenly coated.</li>
    <li><b>Step 2:</b>Cover the pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and crimp tightly around the edges. Place on top of another large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and then wrap the foil up over the pan. All seams should be rolled facing up. Repeat with 2 more sheets of aluminum foil.</li>
    <li><b>Step 3:</b>Place pan next to a campfire, or in a charcoal grill, and arrange the burning coals evenly around the pan. Wrap a sheet pan in foil, place over the pan, and arrange some charcoal on top.</li>
    <li><b>Step 4:</b>Use a probe or laser thermometer to check the temperature on the surface of the bottom pan, as well as the ambient temperature next to the pan. Try to maintain a constant temperature of between 250 to 300 degrees F (120 to 150 degrees C). To do this, move charcoal further away or closer to the pan as needed. If cooking next to a campfire and the pan is getting more heat from one direction than the other, rotate the pan occasionally. Cook until falling-apart tender, 4 to 5 hours.</li>
    <li><b>Step 5:</b>Remove pan from the fire, and let rest for up to 1 hour, or serve immediately. Carefully cut foil away and peel back. Serve made into tacos, nachos, or enjoyed in hot dog or hamburger buns.</li>
  </ol>
